This is a little repositoy storing my homework and exercise in CS61B spring 2018.
Also there are some java learning files in this repository.
As I learnt java from other books, I didn't do the first two classes' exercises.

It has been a long time since last time I'm learning this datastructure class.
So this in this summer break I must finish the whole lesson.
