# CS61B Fall 2020 Courses Practice

This repository stores my homework and exercises for the CS61B Fall 2020 course. Additionally, it contains some Java learning files.

## Overview

I learned Java from other books, so I didn't do the exercises for the first two classes.

It has been a long time since I last studied this data structure class. Therefore, during this summer break, I must finish the entire lesson.

## Progress

Finally, I completed the course. I completed all the projects except for Project 3 and Project 2d Part IV.
